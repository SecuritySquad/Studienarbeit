\textbf{Abstract} 
\end{center}
Today every fifth person is a victim of cyber crime. This is, because most websites on the web
aren't secure and have vulerabilities which are exploitet by hackers. The standard Internet user
cannot see, wether a website is attacking his browser. This is the reason this paper and the
related project were brought into being. We present \textit{webifier}, an open source web
application, which checks wether a website is malicious or not. It guarantees security for the
user, as it runs on a webserver, and it guarantees security for the maintaining web administrators,
because every test ist encapsulated in an own Docker container. It identifies security issues and
client side attacks ranging from simple SSL certificate checking over advanced network analysis to
sophisticated virus scanning. There is a total of eight different tests, whereby this number can be
increased by developing more tests and configuring them into the application. \textit{webifier}
provides as a secure, feature rich and user friendly alternative to existing online security
scanners.
