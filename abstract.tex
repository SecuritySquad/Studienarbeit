\textbf{Abstract} 
\end{center}
Today every fifth person is a victim of cyber crime. This is, because most websites on the web
are not secure and have vulnerabilities which are exploited by hackers. An average internet user
cannot see, wether a website is attacking his browser. This is the reason this paper and the
related project were brought into being. We present \textit{webifier}, an open source web
application, which checks websites on malicious content. It guarantees security for the
user, as it runs on a webserver, and it guarantees security for the maintaining web administrators,
because every test is encapsulated in an independent Docker container. It identifies security issues
and client side attacks ranging from simple certificate checking over advanced network analysis to
sophisticated virus scanning.
At the time of writing there is a total of eight different tests, whereby this number can be
increased by developing more tests and integrating them into the application.
It is not as mature as to call it a high-class security validator, but it provides a secure, easy
expandable, feature rich and user friendly alternative to existing online security scanners.
